# dotfiles

My config files.  A lot of this is copied from [geerlingguy/dotfiles](https://github.com/geerlingguy/dotfiles).

## Shell Setup

Link `.zshrc` from this repository to `$HOME/.zshrc`.  Machine specific configuration can be placed in
`$HOME/.zshrc.local`.

## Homebrew

Additional software is managed using [Homebrew Bundle](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle).  Linux and macOS
setups are located in `brew/linux/` and `brew/macos/`.  Software can be installed using `brew bundle install`, and
cleanup done with `brew bundle cleanup`.
