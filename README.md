# dotfiles

My config files.  A lot of this is copied from [geerlingguy/dotfiles](https://github.com/geerlingguy/dotfiles).
Mainly used with macOS machines.

## Shell Setup

Link files from this directory into $HOME.  That's it.

## Homebrew

Software installs are managed using [Homebrew Bundle](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle).  Personal and work
setups are located in `brew/personal` and `brew/work`.  Software can be installed using `brew bundle install`, and
cleanup done with `brew bundle cleanup`.
